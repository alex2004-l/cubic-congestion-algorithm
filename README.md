### Cubic TCP Algorithm Implementation
---

This repository contains the implementation of the ___CUBIC TCP congestion control algorithm in C++___.
The CUBIC TCP algorithm enhances network performance by employing a cubic growth function to adjust the congestion window size. This approach ensures stability and fairness across multiple network flows, even in challenging environments with high latency and bandwidth.

### Features
- Efficient congestion control using the CUBIC algorithm
- TCP-friendliness for compatibility with standard TCP flows
- Dynamic adjustment of congestion window based on network feedback
- Fair bandwidth distribution across multiple flows
